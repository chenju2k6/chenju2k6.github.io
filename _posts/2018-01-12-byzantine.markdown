The Byzantine Generals Problem asks how a commanding general sends an order to his n-1 lieutenant generals such that,
1, All loyal lieutenants obey the same order
2, If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant obeys the order he sends.

Surprisingly, there's no solution to this problem unless two thirds of the generals are loyal.
