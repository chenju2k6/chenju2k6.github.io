# Self-modifying code 
```
https://web.archive.org/web/20100717072236/http://public.carnet.hr/~jbrecak/sm.html
```

This piece of code can't be compiled on Mac, which complains undefined symbols.

Self-modifying code is supported in Enclave? SgxElide uses SMC to support code secrecy... If code can be modified, how about the security and code measurement? 

The "x86 explained" says this"
``` 
For a slightly more detailed trace, the kernel can set
a desired page’s writable (W) attribute to 0 if the page
fault’s error code indicates a read access, and only set
it to 1 for write accesses. Also, applications that use
a page as both code and data (self-modifying code and
107
just-in-time compiling VMs) can be handled by setting a
page’s disable execution (XD) flag to 0 for a data access,
and by carefully accounting for the case where the last
accessed data page is the same as the last accessed code
page
```
