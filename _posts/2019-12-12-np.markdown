## NP-completeness

P means programs that can be solved in polynomial time. NP means the problems which solutions can be "checked" in polynomial time. Clearly, P is a subset of NP. The open question is, does P equal to NP? 

If a problem A can be reduced to B, then B is at least as hard as A. If all the problems in NP can be reduced to a problem Alpha, then Alpha is a NP-hard problem. If Alpha belongs to NP, then Alpha is NP-complete.

## Examples of NP-complete problems

### SAT

### 3-partition

### Tetris
