According to M. Abadi et al. in there [paper](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture/6413#6413), the control flow integrity (CFI) security dictates that software execution must follow a path of a Control-Flow Graph (CFG) determined ahead of time. The below figure shows a method to enforce the CFI.
