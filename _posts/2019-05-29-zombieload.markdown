有的时候我真的怀疑这些漏洞是不是精心设计的后门呢？

Anyway, following the discovery of Meltdown and Spectre in early 2018, this year researchers found a series of attacks exploits the vulnerabilities in the microarchitecture design of the Intel CPU, they are ZombieLoad, Fallout, RIDL and others. I would like to thank the people who draw this excellet interative map illustrating the internal CPU microarchitecture. ![alt text](https://mdsattacks.com/images/skylake-color.svg "Microarchitecure") The interactive map can be found in [here](https://mdsattacks.com/diagram.html). This drawing helps a lot to compare and contrast these attacks.
